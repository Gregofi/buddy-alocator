# buddy-alocator
This is an dummy implementation of budddy allocator, for learning purposes
only. It does not use real memory from OS. It receives pointer to some
memory(for example static array) and does the allocation on top of this memory.

Since the code is not intended for real use, it can be a good starting point
for learning this allocator, because it doesn't have to deal with nuances
like a real allocator would have.
